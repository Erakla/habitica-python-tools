[item][#] a subtask with leading [#]
[priority]2
[tasktype]daily
[frequency]daily
[every_x]3

second example task
subtask1
subtask2
subtask3

first line is only the title
all following lines without [] are subtasks
[tags] are parameters for function account.create_task_for_user()
subtasks with leading [] can use [item] tag
not all possible arguments are tested because i didn't need it in the past
particularly arguments with timestamps are not implemented so far
an empty line initiates a new quest
two blank lines will complete the input and send the quests in reverse order. why backwards?
because the quests are automatically always attached to the top and
you might want to have them in the order in which you wrote them down
